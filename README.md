Amplifund Code Sample

Here is my Code sample for AMplifund's interview process.

Here I've used an Model-Controller set up for a basic .NET REST API. This API is a basic book database. Each book has a title, author, and publish date, with an optional description. 
The Controller is the main entry point with endpoints for all the common actions, get, create, update, destroy. The data is processed in the Repository wher ther is an in memory database to store the books.
